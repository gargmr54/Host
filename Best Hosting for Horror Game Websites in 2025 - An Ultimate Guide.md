Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans offer dedicated resources, ensuring consistent performance even during peak times. The "managed" aspect means Scala Hosting takes care of server maintenance, security updates, and technical support, allowing you to focus on your website's content.

### Security Features:
Security is paramount, especially in the gaming world. Scala Hosting includes features like free SSL certificates, daily backups, and a malware scanner to protect your website from online threats. They also provide advanced security options like DDoS protection and server-level firewalls, crucial for preventing attacks.

### Free Website Migration:
If you're already hosting your horror game website elsewhere, Scala Hosting offers free website migration to their platform. Their expert team will handle the entire process, ensuring a smooth transition without any downtime or data loss.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting's shared hosting plans start at competitive prices, making them accessible for new websites. Their managed VPS solutions vary in price depending on the resources allocated, but they offer excellent value for the level of performance and support provided. For example, their Start Cloud plan begins at around $3.95 per month.
